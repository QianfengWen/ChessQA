An interesting idea to start an offensive on the queenside. The b4-square is freed for the manoeuvre of a knight to c6. However the game shows that he had to think of his own king.\nB.

However, 16 Rad1 could possibly cost White a point, at least when playing against a computer.\nC. By pinning the knight on f6 before Black has castled, and especially when the White king is already located on the critical wing, White lays himself open to a violent counterattack. Better is 6 Be3, now or on the next move.\nD. This move highlights the drawbacks of Black's pawn advance. The h5-pawn is weak and its sacrifice does not help much.

White has positional compensation for the pawn due to better development and some dark-squared weaknesses in the Black camp.\nB. If Black simply waits, then White could eventually attack on the kingside, for example\nC. Black is running short of moves. His king and knight are tied to the f pawn, his bishop is on its best diagonal (preventing Nb5) and his queenside pawns are at their best, vulnerable. That leaves the h pawn, yet if Black plays h4 White simply returns his bishop to e8 and his knight to the kingside and infiltrates through the newly weakened g5 square. Black is forced to make a concession and he succeeds in finding the least evil.\nD. I'd prefer to keep the knight on d5 rather than improving White's structure.

Black's central pawn position -- or lack thereof -- is typical of the Steinitzian precedents, but here White still has ad-pawn. This gives him potentially better chances than the absence of both centre pawns, as the d-pawn may help support the knight at a variety of central posts, e.g., e4 or c4, although neither of these squares is absolutely secure", "fen_before": "r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2pn4/4R3/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB3K1 b kq - 0 10", "fen_after": "r1b1k2r/ppp1b1pp/2pn1p2/4R3/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB3K1 w kq - 0 11", "move_uci": "f7f6", "move_number": 10, "side_to_move": "white"}}

This is the problem. White still has the initiative, but more and more material is coming off the board meaning that the game is becoming very drawish.\nB. Black has a space advantage and White's knight is misplaced. However Black must open up the kingside to give scope to his bishops. In this process it is quite possible that many pawns may get exchanged on the kingside. Hence Black must retain his light coloured bishop to attack the weakness on a4.\nC. Black is running short of moves. His king and knight are tied to the f pawn, his bishop is on its best diagonal (preventing Nb5) and his queenside pawns are at their best, vulnerable. That leaves the h pawn, yet if Black plays h4 White simply returns his bishop to e8 and his knight to the kingside and infiltrates through the newly weakened g5 square.

Black is still far from equality.

White probably thought that Black would have difficulty castling. In fact, Black demonstrates that his king is better placed than if it had already castled, as the position is tending toward an endgame and his king is already in the centre. Black's central pawn position -- or lack thereof -- is typical of the Steinitzian precedents, but here White still has ad-pawn. This gives him potentially better chances than the absence of both centre pawns, as the d-pawn may help support the knight at a variety of central posts, e.g., e4 or c4, although neither of these squares is absolutely secure\nC.
